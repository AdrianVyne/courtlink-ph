# CourtLink PH Pause / Resume Handoff

Last updated: 2026-07-02 (Asia/Manila)

## Resume prompt

> Resume CourtLink PH from `PAUSE.md`. Current effort: the web experience redesign. Read
> `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-02-web-experience-redesign-design.md` and execute
> `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-02-web-experience-redesign.md` phase by phase from the first
> unchecked phase. Work on `main`; run the phase gate (`pnpm check` +
> `pnpm --filter @courtlink/web test:e2e`) before each commit; push after each phase; plain
> commit messages without co-author trailers; update `PAUSE.md` before stopping.

## Current checkpoint

- Public repository: `https://github.com/AdrianVyne/courtlink-ph`
- Branch: `main` (marketplace feature-complete; see previous checkpoint below).
- Active effort: **web experience redesign** — spec and 10-phase plan committed 2026-07-02.
- Phase status: no phases executed yet. Start at Phase 1 (design system foundation).
- Root checkout has unrelated untracked `config.yaml` and `static/` — do not touch.
- The `.worktrees/foundation` worktree is from the completed foundation effort; redesign work
  happens directly on `main` in the root checkout.

## Prior effort (complete)

The marketplace is feature-complete: auth (email + Google OAuth), courts (inventory, discovery,
holds, proof review, refunds), coaches (profiles, offers, atomic winner), web workspaces,
notifications, email, operations, Docker/Caddy production stack, 240+ unit tests, 83 integration
tests, Playwright + axe e2e scaffold.

Known operational items (not blockers): CI dependency/container scans, live Google OAuth
verification, clean Oracle VM deployment.
